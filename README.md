# TGF Oude Aard

TGF stands for "Tekstowa Gra Fabularna" which means "text-based role-playing game".

Oude Aard is a fully complete online service that includes an account creation tool, a web forum, real-time chats and a built-in store. Created with React.js and Redux.js for FrontEnd and using Node.js / Express.js and Google Firebase for Backend.

"Oude Aard" is a project co-created with a graphic designer who will later be responsible for the full graphic layer. The current graphic and CSS layer serves only the basic highlighting of some sections of the page and symbolizes the later layout.

The site currently has 75% of functionalities, including setting up an account supported by the firebase authentication system, the rank system limiting the possibility of creating new topics on the built-in forum or replying to these topics. Thanks to the use of firebase firestore, the player is notified in real time about a new private message or a new post on the topic being watched. Implementing the TinyMCE editor gives you almost unlimited post editing options.
